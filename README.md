diff1D_OAE.m integrates in time the 1D diffusion equations in ther vertical dimension for TA and DIC with air-sea gas exchange at the surface. By running pairs of simulations, one with "background" initial conditions of TA and DIC, and a second with "perturbed" TA (representing an alkalinity addition), one can compute the uptake of CO2 due to the intervention, specifically including the effects of vertical mixing. The model requires a prescribed profile of diffusivity. Dependencies include CO2SYS.m v3.1.1   (Feb  2021: https://github.com/jonathansharp/CO2-System-Extd) and FCO2.m (Cecilia Chapa Balcorta). The model is fully described in submitted publications by Stokes, Ostiguy, Musgrave and Peacock, and Ostiguy, Stokes, Peacock and Musgrave, 2025.
